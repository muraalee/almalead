Assignment
Functional Requirements
Develop an application to support creating, getting and updating leads. A lead is a form PUBLICLY available for prospects to fill in, the required fields include,

Once the lead is submitted by a prospect, the application will send emails to both the prospect and an attorney inside the company.

In addition, the application powers an internal UI guarded by auth to render a list of leads with all the information filled in by the prospect. Each lead also has a state, it starts with a PENDING state and transitions to REACHED_OUT when marked manually by an attorney after he / she reaches out to the prospect.

Create a system design to fulfill the above requirements

Implement all APIs needed to fulfill the above requirements (there is no need to develop UI)

Use FastAPI to implement the application

Add a storage to persist data

Properly structure the code similar to how you would for a production level repo



Submission Guidance
Submit your code to a publicly available github repo

Submit a document on how to run your application locally in the same repo

Submit a design document on why/how you make those design choices in the same repo

Any additional documents that could help us understand the application better in the same repo

Upload the github link in the assignment document within 6 hours since you start the exercise
